Laudan’s Normative Naturalism 301 

The point of the example, rather, is that methodological rules are not justified 
instrumentally. This can be seen by dropping talk of aims and goals altogether, 
and restoring Q and R to ‘elliptical’ form: 

Q’: Prefer double-blind to single-blind experiments. 
R’: Prefer single-blind to double-blind experiments. 

We all agree that Q’, not R’, is the justified methodological rule. But its 
justification has nothing to do with its instrumental efficacy in realizing some 
cognitive aim. Q’ is justified, not instrumentally, but epistemically: double- 
blind experimentation provides better evidence for a drug’s efficacy than single- 
blind experimentation, because it controls for an additional source of possible 
error (namely, bias created by researcher expectation transmitted to subjects 
and manifested in the placebo effect). The fact that double-blind experimen- 
tation controls for this possible source of experimental error, which single- 
blind experimentation does not, establishes that R’ is less well justified than Q’. 
R’s unjustifiedness is not a function of instrumental efficacy: as the example 
above illustrates, single-blind experimentation can be plausibly thought to be 
more instrumentally efficacious than double-blind experimentation, with 
respect to plausible research goals. However instrumentally efficacious single- 
blind experimentation might be, however, double-blind experimentation con- 
trols for an additional source of possible bias/experimental error, and so 
affords stronger evidence for a drug’s efficacy, than single-blind experimen- 
tation; for that reason, Q’ is the justified methodological rule here. This would 
be so even if the research community adopted the goals articulated in R - that 
is, even if we adopted those goals, we would be more justified in believing that 
drug/therapy D really works if the evidence for that belief stems from double- 
blind experimentation than we would be if our belief was based on numerically 
equivalent data stemming from single-blind experimentation. Our belief about 
D is better justified in the first circumstance because double-blind experimen- 
tation provides better evidence for such claims and is more epistemically 
forceful; methodological rule Q’ is more justified than R’ because it affords 
greater epistemic weight than R’ to the results of experiments of the sort it 
urges. The justification of methodological rules is an epistemic, not an instru- 
mental, matter: in general, a rule is justified insofar as it confers warrant to the 
results of experiments conducted in accordance with its directives.4 

In some circumstances we might be pragmatically justified in utilizing the 
less justified R’, for example when we have an overriding interest in testing a 
large number of drugs/therapies and can tolerate a real but small experimental 

‘The justification of methodological rules proceeds in accordance with relevant epistemic 
principles; in the case under discussion, the principle might be something like ‘A methodological 
rule is justified insofar as it maximizes the probability that experimentation conducted in 
accordance with it leads to true (or valid) results’. Of course there is much more to be said about 
such principles and their epistemic status.
