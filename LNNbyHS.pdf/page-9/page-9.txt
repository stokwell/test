error (e.g. in an epidemic). But this would not show that R’ is a better justified 
methodological rule than Q’. Q’ is better justified because it controls for a 
possible source of error for which R’ does not control. The greater control 
afforded by double-blind experimentation provides greater warrant for the 
results of such experimentation; the fact that double-blind methodology yields 
more highly warranted research conclusions establishes the methodological 
superiority and justifiedness of Q’. We should not confuse the (true) claim that 
we are pragmatically justified in some circumstances in utilizing an epistemi- 
tally less well justified methodological rule, with the (false) claim that in such 
circumstances the less well justified rule becomes or is more justified. So long as 
R’s epistemic credentials are inferior to Q”s credentials, Q’ will be a better 
justified methodological rule than R’, whatever our pragmatic circumstances 

happen to be. This is a familiar point which extends far beyond the context of 
methodology: as a hostage or prisoner of war I may be pragmatically justified 
in the extreme in believing that my government will do everything in its power 
to rescue me; that belief, nevertheless, may be epistemically unjustified in light 
of the total relevant evidence. 

Notice that I am not challenging Laudan’s naturalism here. He is correct 
that it is an empirical matter that double-blind experimentation controls for a 
source of possible error that single-blind experimentation does not. This 
should not be a surprise; evidence is typically empirical and ‘natural’. The 
present challenge is rather to Laudan’s instrumentalism. It is not the instru- 
mental relationship of means to ends which justifies methodological rules; it is 
rather the epistemic features of methodological rules which affords them 
whatever justification they enjoy. 

Laudan’s instrumentalist account of methodological rules and the rational 
resolution of disputes concerning them constitutes an instrumentalist view of 
scientific rationality; it presupposes an instrumentalist view of rationality more 
generally. This aspect of Laudan’s instrumentalism is also problematic. 

IV. Instrumeatalism and Rationality 

Laudan models his instrumentalist account of scientific rationality on that of 
goal-directed rational action. He claims that a necessary condition of the 
rationality of purposive action is the actor’s belief that her action furthers her 
aims, and simply applies that model of rational action to the scientist. So 
applied, scientific rationality is measured by the degree to which it is believed 
that scientific research, as guided by its methodological rules, realizes its aims: 

When we say that an agent acted rationally, we are asserting minimally that he acted 
in ways which he believed would promote his ends. Determining that an agent acted 
in a manner that he believed would promote his ends may or may not be sufficient to 
show the rationality of his actions; philosophers will quarrel about that matter. But
