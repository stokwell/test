them. It is ironic that it is Laudan who in the work we are considering ignores 
this epistemic sense of rationality, for in his earlier book he made it central: 

At its core, rationality . . . consists in doing (or believing) things because we have 
good reasons for doing so . . if we are going to determine whether a given action or 
belief is (or was) rational, we must ask whether there are (or were) sound reasons for 
it (Laudan, 1977, p. 123).’ 

If rationality is a function of good reasons, then instrumentalism cannot be the 
whole story about rationality, unless the only sort of good reason there can be 
is an instrumental reason. But we have no reason to think that instrumental 
reasons are the only sort of reasons there are. Indeed, on Laudan’s own 
instrumentalist view he needs a non-instrumental species of reasons to estab- 
lish instrumental efficacy: 

. . . inquiry exemplifies the general notion of practical reason and practical action. 
The conduct of a given inquiry will be rational just insofar as we have grounds to 
believe that that inquiry process will be likely to realize our ends . . . (Laudan, 1988, 
p. 349, second emphasis added). 

What will such ‘grounds’ be like? They will not themselves be ‘instrumentali- 
ties’; rather, they will be evidence - evidence that the inquiry process in 
question is indeed likely to allow us to realize our ends. Consider our earlier 
methodological rule concerning double-blind experimentation. What counts as 
grounds for thinking that inquiry conducted according to that rule will help us 
to realize our end (of establishing that tested drugs/therapies are (not) genui- 
nely effective)? Grounds for this claim are constituted simply by empirical 
evidence that double-blind experimentation in fact eliminates a sort of experi- 
mental error not eliminated by other procedures of inquiry. The grounds in 
question are nothing but evidence that a proposition relating ends and means 
is true; that the sought-after relation indeed obtains. Thus to establish the 
instrumental efficacy of a methodological rule, we need, on Laudan’s own 
account, non-instrumental evidence which provides good reason for thinking 
that an instrumental relation in fact holds between (acting in accordance with) 
that rule and some end of inquiry. Thus even on Laudan’s own account it is 
not the case that the only sort of good reasons there are are instrumental ones, 
or that instrumental rationality is the only sort of rationality science or 
purposive action can have. In seeing this we see that we have good reason to 

‘As Laudan notes in the text surrounding this passage, the thesis that rationality involves good 
reasons is not itself a theory of rationality (although it is a constraint which such theories must 
satisfy); one must provide an account of the constitution of good reasons. Laudan tried to do this 
in his (1977); he has since repudiated that account, and in the work under discussion here offers an 
alternative account. I have been arguing that this new account fails; the irony here consists in the 
fact that Laudan’s new account fails to recognize as a constraint on the theory of rationality that, 
as the cited passage states, such a theory must involve good reasons. If Laudan’s earlier theory 
failed, at least it recognized this constraint. Thanks to Harold 1. Brown for challenging cormpnn- 
dence concerning this point.
