means; (b) an instrumentalist conception of (scientific) rationality; (c) a natura- 
listic, instrumentalist treatment of the axiology of science; and (d) a commit- 
ment to a thoroughgoing naturalism in philosophy of science. Each of these 
aspects of Laudan’s position is, I believe, problematic. 

III. Methodology and Instrumentality 

As we have seen, Laudan treats methodological rules as hypothetical 
imperatives which relate cognitive ends with means which are efficacious for 
the realization of those ends. Such methodological rules are justified instru- 
mentally and empirically: a methodological rule is justified to the extent that 
we have reason to believe that the means it recommends really are the most 
efficient way we know of bringing about the end;’ and empirical, scientific 
inquiry provides us with whatever reason to believe this that we have. 

Consider the methodological rule (discussed in Laudan, 1984, pp. 38-39) 
which might ordinarily be stated: 

Q’: Prefer double-blind to single-blind experiments. 

On Laudan’s view, this rule is stated elliptically, for the aims which the rule 
is alleged to further are not mentioned. In full hypothetical form, the rule 
should be formulated as follows: 

Q: If one wants to learn whether a drug or therapy is genuinely effective, prefer 
double-blind to single-blind experiments. 

According to Laudan, Q is justified by empirical considerations which demon- 
strate the efficacy of double-blind experiments in realizing its stated end. If we 
want to know whether some particular drug or therapy is genuinely effective, 
we are instrumentally well-advised to conduct double-blind rather than single- 
blind experiments. 

Why are we so well-advised? It is because we have learned that single-blind 
experiments, in which the researcher but not the subject knows whether the 
subject is receiving the experimental drug/therapy or a control, are not reliable 
indicators of drug/therapy efficacy. This is because researchers in single-blind 
experiments can and do convey to subjects their own therapeutic expectations, 
which render experimental results unreliable because they fail to control for 
subject expectation (the placebo effect). So, if we want to know whether the 
drug/therapy under test is efficacious, and we want to rule out the possibility 
that positive test results are the result not of the drug’s efficacy but rather of 
the subject’s expectations of improvement, we had better rule out subject 
expectations which result from unconscious transmission of the researcher’s 
expectations to the subject. We do this by utilizing double-blind methodology, 

‘This is not quite right, for it neglects Laudan’s account of the naturalistic justification of ends. 
We will consider Laudan’s discussion of axiology below.
