LAUDAN’S NORMATIVE NATURALISM 

Abstract - Unlike more standard non-normative naturalizations of epistemology and 
philosophy of science, Larry Laudan’s naturalized philosophy of science explicitly 
maintains a normative dimension. This paper critically assesses Laudan’s normative 
naturalism. After summarizing Laudan’s position, the paper examines: (1) Laudan’s 
construal of methodological rules as ‘instrumentalities’ connecting methodological 
means and cognitive ends; (2) Laudan’s instrumental conception of scientific rationa- 
lity; (3) Laudan’s naturalistic account of the axiology of science; and (4) the extent to 
which a normative philosophy of science can be naturalized. It is concluded that 
Laudan’s normative naturalism is as problematic as its non-normative naturalist 

cousins. 

Introduction 

RECENT epistemology and philosophy of science have been characterized by a 
turn toward ‘naturalism’. Different authors have filled out their proposals for 
naturalization in different ways, of course, but for all of them naturalization 
involves the settling of epistemological/philosophical questions by appeal to 
science: for the naturalized epistemologist, to the scientific study of language 
learning and belief forming and sustaining; for the naturalized philosopher of 
science, to the scientific study of science and its practitioners. In both domains 
what is advocated is the scientific study of the natural processes by which 
beliefs and theories are acquired, maintained, and altered in the light of 
experience. 

This turn to science has been thought by many naturalists to involve the 
abandonment of the normative questions concerning rationality and justifica- 
tion which have characterized traditional epistemology and philosophy of 
science. Quine, for example, is widely (though not uncontroversially) held to 
think that naturalizing epistemology involves replacing epistemology with 
psychology, and refraining from engaging in the traditional project of con- 
structing a normative theory of evidence; ’ Giere’s naturalized philosophy of
