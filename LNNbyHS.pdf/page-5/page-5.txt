immediately reveals the sense in which methodology, for Laudan, is 
naturalized: 

Crediting or discrediting a methodological rule requires us to ask ourselves whether 
the universe we inhabit is one in which our cognitive ends can in fact be furthered by 
following this rule rather than that. Such questions cannot be answered a priori; they 
are empirical matters. It follows that scientific methodology is itself an empirical 
discipline which cannot dispense with the very methods of inquiry whose validity it 
investigates. Armchair methodology is as ill-conceived as armchair chemistry or 
physics (Laudan, 1984, pp. 39-40). 

I am suggesting that we conceive rules or maxims as resting on claims about the 
empirical world, claims to be assayed in precisely the same ways in which we test 
other empirical theories. Methodological rules, on this view, are a part of empirical 
knowledge, not something wholly different from it (Laudan, 1987, p. 24; see also 
Laudan, 1988, pp. 349-350; Laudan, 1987a, p. 231). 

Our final preliminary is to trace out the connections between Laudan’s 

naturalism and his normative conception of rationality. Laudan’s account of 

rationality is thoroughly instrumentalist: 

Whatever else rationality is, it is agent- and context-specific. When we say that an 
agent acted rationally, we are asserting minimally that he acted in ways which he 
believed would promote his ends (Laudan, 1987, p. 21). 

The conduct of a given inquiry will be rational just insofar as we have grounds to 
believe that that inquiry process will be likely to realize our ends . . (Laudan, 1988, 
p. 349, emphasis in original). 

Whatever else it is, rational behavior consists in selecting actions which we believe 
are conducive to our ends (Laudan, 1987a, p. 227). 

. an empirical approach to epistemology requires attention to precisely those 
normative linkages between cognitive ends and means which constitute scientific 
rationality (Laudan, 1984, p. 41). 

Establishing that actions are conducive to the realization of our ends is an 
empirical matter; hence naturalism. Given that some action is in fact so 

conducive provides reason for engaging in that action; hence normativity (and 

rationality). Thus we have Laudan’s normative naturalism: naturalistic inquiry 

tells us what we can do to further our ends, and, given that they are our ends, 

what we ought to do to bring about their realization. The rationality of science 

involves simply the ‘normative linkages between cognitive ends and means’. 

Methodological rules linking such ends and means 

retain all the normative force associated with any prudential rule of conduct, yet 
they derive their warrant from empirical information about how this particular 
world is constituted. One can thus “naturalize” methodology . . without being 
forced . . to believe that making it empirical and descriptive robs it of its normative 
force (Laudan, 1988, p. 350). 

Laudan’s normative naturalism centrally involves: (a) the construal of 
methodological rules as ‘instrumentalities’ connecting cognitive ends and
